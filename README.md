# Samurai Champloo themed Landing page

This is a simple page made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Main goal of this project was to become more familiar with basic HTML and CSS. I also used Sass preprocessor for the first time. I tried my best to make this page responsible

## Notes
The Javascript code may seem a little confusing to you, it happened because I did everything according to tutorials, without having any basic knowledge. I will be happy to receive any feedback
